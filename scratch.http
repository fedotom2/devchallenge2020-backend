  "content": "When your focus is to improve employee performance, ongoing dialogue between managers and their direct reports is essential. While performance management often involves conducting annual performance evaluations, it does involve more than just that. Many companies donâ€™t do formal performance appraisals anymore. Instead, they encourage one-on-one dialogues in which supervisors hold meetings with employees as a way to facilitate two-way communication and one-on one dialogue. These are done on a quarterly or monthly basis. "
